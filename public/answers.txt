//JavaScript
1. My favourite new javascript feature is Nullish Coalescing & Equals (??=)

2. We can use this feature to reduce code. For example, in vanilla javascript we use this code (result = (a !== null && a !== undefined) ? a : b;) but with this 
feature we can write like this (result = a ?? b).

3. If you are using arrow function and you have one parameter you can remove parentheses and also you can remove return statement and write your code in one line.

4. myFunctionCall(++foo) returns the value of foo after it has been incremented. It is a pre-increment operator since ++ comes before the operand.
myFunctionCall(foo++) returns the value of foo before incrementing. It is a post-increment operator since ++ comes after the operand.

5. With class you can use inheritance more easily. But in prototype inheritance, an object is instantiated directly from another parent object, without ever needing any "blueprints".

//Css
6. In HTML you create website structure, but in CSS you make website design and you can also make awesome animations to make your website unique.
7. We use !important when we want to set priority in any css style.
8. I prefer flex, because it gives you a lot of opportunity and with flex you can make your design responsive.
9. They are legal and you can use it when it is necessary.
10. We will set <div> tag style overflow: hidden

//Unit Testing
11. I have an idea of Jest testing tool, but I never used it in practice.
